Exercise app made as part of a job application for StackBuilders from 8/may/2018 9/may/2018

Calculates if the user must pay a fine or is ok to drive giving a date, an hour and a licence plate, according to [the Ecuadorian law.](http://www.amt.gob.ec/index.php/pico-placa-homepage.html)

Peak hours are from Monday to Friday, from 07H00 to 09H30 and from 16H00 to 19H30.
The fine is given according to the last digit of the license plate.

To test the app, the apk can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/fbtw/picoyplaca/blob/master/apk/debug/app-debug.apk)**

## Notes:
The app doesn't validate if the hours and plate are too long or too short, only if the final digit is a number.
